X11 Apps Test - Windows
=======================

Note: Native X11 client applications (xclock, xeyes, etc.) are not available
on Windows as MSYS2/MinGW does not provide X11 client libraries.

This job verifies that:
1. x11anywhere compiles successfully with Windows backend
2. The server starts and listens on the configured port

For actual X11 protocol testing on Windows, see the visual_test.rs tests
which use Rust-based X11 protocol testing.
